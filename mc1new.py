# # Problem Description
# Tiny ImageNet contains 100'000 images of 200 classes (500 for each class) downsized to 64Ã—64 colored images. Each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images and 50 test images.

# # Metrics
# For the evaluation of the model, we will use accuracy as our metric. It is straightforward and defined as follows:
# $$ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{correct classifications}}{\text{all classifications}} $$
# 
# However, accuracy has a disadvantage for multiclass classification problems, as it does not consider class imbalances. If our model is biased towards one class, and that class has the highest occurrence, accuracy may fail to reflect this bias. In our case, since the dataset does not have class imbalances, accuracy should be sufficient for our evaluation.
# 
# To estimate the error in the chosen metric, we could also consider using an alternative metric like the F1 Score, which penalizes false predictions rather than just summarizing the correct ones.
# 

# # Base Architecture
# - The base model consists of two convolutional layers for feature extraction and two pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimension of the image. Two fully connected layer ensure enough parameters. The goal is to train with a single sample or batch and to show that it works as well as in the next step to find a proper learning rate and batch size.

# ## Discussion

# # SGD, Tuning of Learning Rate and Batch Size
# - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization method. Unlike traditional gradient descent, where we train on the entire dataset, SGD updates model parameters using a small batch of the data. This enables faster learning, say faster convergence to local (global) minima, and is therefore more efficient.
# - The learning rate controls how much the model's weights are adjusted in response to the error at each step of training. A small learning rate increases the training time, while a large learning rate speeds up training but can cause the model to overshoot and fail to converge.
# - The batch size refers to the number of training examples used for updating the model's weights. The key idea is that using smaller groups to update the weights will also allow the model to generalize well, as the batch acts as a proxy for the whole dataset.
# 
# First, we'll conduct an overfitting test by training on a small dataset of 100 samples, expecting the loss to decrease and accuracy to increase. Then, we'll search for the highest learning rate that still allows convergence. Finally, we'll determine a batch size that is memory efficient and balances representation of the data statistics with minimizing noise.

# ## Discussion
# Our overfitting test with SGD and 100 samples (full batch) shows that the algorithm works. It convergences as expected and the accuracy increases up to 100% and shows clearly overfitting.
# 
# For the right learning rate and batch size, there are two candidates which show a proper convergence and a high increase in accuracy:
# 
#   - LR=0.001 and BS=32
# 
#     Enables more frequent gradient updates and to capture the statistics of a smaller batch size. In doing so, we hope to reduce the risk of overfitting on the training data.
#     
#   - LR=0.01 and BS=64
#   
#     Enables faster model training because a higher learning rate results in larger steps during weight updates, say speeding up convergence. A larger batch size reduces the number of gradient updates per epoch, which can make training more efficient, though it may also affect the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.

# # SGD, Weight Initialization, Model Complexity, Convolution Settings
# - `TODO` Explain what you will do here

# ## Weight Initialization `TODO`
# 1. **Kaiming Initialization**:
#    - Weights are drawn from a normal distribution.
#    - Variance is scaled by $\frac{2}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of input units in the layer.
#    - This scaling helps prevent signal attenuation (very small signals) or signal explosion (very large signals) in deeper layers.
# 
# 2. **Random Uniform Initialization**:
#    - Weights are drawn uniformly from a fixed range, typically between \((-0.1, 0.1)\).
#    - This can lead to issues in deeper networks as signals may attenuate or explode due to lack of variance scaling based on the layer's depth or size.

# ### Discussion

# ## Model Complexity
# We will examine four different model variants with varying levels of complexity by adjusting the number of layers, units, or filters per layer. Additionally, we will monitor the learning curves to ensure that the training process remains stable.
# 
# I hypothesize that Tiny ImageNet will benefit from a deeper architectureâ€”specifically, increasing the number of convolutional layers. This enhancement should enable the model to learn more complex patterns, and be get better in differentiation between 200 classes.
# 
# For the four proposed model variants, I will progressively increase the number of convolutional layers while decreasing the number of units in each dense layer. This strategy should mitigate overfitting by reducing the total number of parameters.

# ### Model Variant 1
# 
# **Architecture:**
# - **Convolutional layers:**
#   - 3x3 conv, 16 channels
#   - 3x3 conv, 32 channels
#   - Pooling layer with kernel size 2
# 
# - **Fully connected layers:**
#   - fc 500 units
#   - fc 500 units
# 
# **Evaluation:**
# - This architecture includes two convolutional and two fully connected (linear) layers.
# - The convolutional layers are effective for capturing spatial patterns within the input images.
# - The fully connected layers, with 500 units each, significantly increase the number of parameter, which can raises the risk of overfitting.
# 
# **Future considerations:**
# - Increase the number of convolutional layers.
# - Reduce the number of units in the fully connected layers.

# ### Model Variant 2
# 
# **Architecture Changes**:
# - **Convolutional Layers**:
#   - Initial layers: 3x3 conv, 16 and 3x3 conv, 32.
#   - Additional layer added: 3x3 conv, 64.
# - **Pooling**:
#   - Two pooling layers with a stride of 2.
#   - Spatial dimension reduced to 14x14.
# - **Fully Connected Layers**:
#   - Reduced units in the fully connected layer from 500 to 400.
# 
# **Parameter Impact**:
# - The added convolutional layer with 64 filters (3x3 kernel) increases parameters by **18,400**.
# - Reducing the fully connected layer units from 500 to 400 cuts linear parameters by more than half.
# 
# **Performance Expectation**:
# - **Feature Extraction**: Enhanced by the added convolutional layer, increasing the depth of representation.
# - **Overfitting Reduction**: Simplifying the fully connected layer may reduce overfitting.

# ### Model Variant 4
# 
# Architecture:
# 
# - **Convolutional Layers**:
#   - **First Stage**: Two 3x3 convolutional layers with 16 and 32 channels, followed by a pooling layer (stride 2) to reduce spatial dimensions.
#   - **Second Stage**: Two 3x3 convolutional layers with 64 channels, followed by a pooling layer (stride 2).
#   - **Third Stage**: Two 3x3 convolutional layers with 128 channels, followed by a pooling layer (stride 2).
# - **Fully Connected Layers**:
#   - First fully connected layer with 500 units.
#   - Second fully connected layer with 200 units.
# 
# - **Feature Extraction**: The model applies three stages of convolutional layers with increasing channel depth (16, 32, 64, and 128), interspersed with pooling layers to downsample spatial dimensions.
# - **Gradual Detail Extraction**: Multiple convolutional layers before each pooling step help extract detailed features progressively while reducing spatial dimensions.
# - **Output Dimensions**: Starting with an input size of (3, 64, 64) for channels, height, and width, the model outputs a final feature map of (128, 4, 4), representing a dense, high-level feature representation.
# - **Parameter Count**: Approximately 1.4 million parameters, which is the lowest so far.
# - **Performance Expectation**: With this setup, the model should show the best performance so far by extracting the most patterns and saving them to the feature space.

# ### Discussion
# 
# - Comparing the training and validation loss/accuracy plots from the first to the fourth model variant reveals:
#   - The gap between training and validation loss narrows.
#   - The same trend is observed for training and validation accuracy.
#   - While the validation loss increased after 5 epochs in the first model, it only rises after 15 epochs in the last model.
#   - Although accuracy on the training set reached 100% for the first three variants, the last layer achieves a maximum accuracy of 35% after 20 epochs.
#   - The validation accuracy increases alongside the training accuracy, achieving the narrowest gap, but still remains between 15% and 20%.
# 
# The steady improvements from the first to the last variant are due to:
#   - Increasing the number of convolutional layers, which expands the feature space and extracts more patterns from the images.
#     - This increases the overall parameters only slightly compared to fully connected layers.
#   - Reducing the units in the fully connected layers, decreasing the total parameters from 14.4 million to 1 million. This simplification prevents the model from overfitting.

# # Regularization
# 
# Regularization helps mitigate overfitting and enhances a modelâ€™s ability to generalize to unseen data. There are several ways to achieve regularization, two of which are:
# 
# **L1 and L2 Regularization**  
# With L1 and L2 regularization, we penalize the model's weights by adding a regularization term to the loss function. This approach reduces the model's reliance on large weights.
# 
# - **L1 Regularization**: Adds the absolute value of each weight to the loss function. This encourages sparsity, often driving some weights to zero. The regularized loss function \( L \) with L1 regularization is:
# 
#   $$
#   L = L_0 + \lambda \sum_{i} |w_i|
#   $$
# 
#   where \( L_0 \) is the original loss, \( \lambda \) is the regularization strength, and \( w_i \) are the model weights.
# 
# - **L2 Regularization**: Adds the square of each weight to the loss function, discouraging large weights but not forcing them to zero, which helps smooth the learned patterns. The regularized loss function with L2 regularization is:
# 
#   $$
#   L = L_0 + \lambda \sum_{i} w_i^2
#   $$
# 
# **Dropout**  
# In dropout, we randomly set a proportion \( p \) of units (neurons) to zero for each training update. By disabling certain connections, dropout prevents over-reliance on specific paths.

# ## L1/L2 Regularization
# 
# We will evaluate both L1 and L2 regularization methods by conducting multiple training runs with different regularization strengths (Î»). Each method will be compared against a baseline model without regularization.
# 
# **Expectation**
# 
# **Training Loss:**
# - Models with regularization should exhibit higher training loss
# - This is expected because we're adding penalty terms to the loss function:
#   - L1: Î»âˆ‘|w| (sum of absolute weights)
#   - L2: Î»âˆ‘wÂ² (sum of squared weights)
# - The higher loss indicates that we're preventing the model from overfitting to the training data
# 
# **Validation Loss:**
# - Models with regularization should demonstrate:
#   - Lower validation loss in the long run
#   - Better generalization to unseen data
#   - Delayed onset of overfitting
# - Without regularization:
#   - Validation loss typically starts increasing early, i.e. shows earlier signs of overfitting
# - With regularization:
#   - Validation loss should remain stable for longer
#   - The gap between training and validation loss should be smaller
# 
# We'll test this by comparing the following configurations:
# - No regularization (baseline)
# - L1 with Î» âˆˆ {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01}
# - L2 with Î» âˆˆ {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01}

# ### Discussion
# 
# `TODO run 15 epochs`
# 
# **L1 Regularization**
# 
# 1. **Impact of High Regularization**
#    - When the regularization strength is too high (Î» âˆˆ {0.001, 0.01}):
#      - The model fails to learn effectively, as indicated by plateaued loss and accuracy.
#      - By adding the absolute values of the weights to the loss function, L1 regularization encourages sparsity.
#      - Weights are forced to zero, resulting in little to no improvement during training.
# 
# 2. **Benefits of Appropriate Regularization**
#    - With a correctly chosen regularization strength (e.g., Î» = 0.0001):
#      - The model shows better performance on the validation set.
#      - Unlike the unregularized model, which experiences an increase in validation loss after a certain point, the regularized model maintains or continues to decrease validation loss for up to 10 epochs.
# 
# **L2 Regularization**
# 
# - **Observations**:
#   - Compared to L1, L2 regularization does not have as strong effects on the weights.
#   - Training and validation losses align much more closely with those of the unregularized variant.
#   - Even higher Î» values for L2 still allow the model to learn effectively.
#   - Experimenting with higher penalties compared to L1 could reveal clearer generalization benefits.
# 
# `TODO write conclusion`

# ## Dropout
# 
# We will apply dropout to the fully connected (linear) layers because:
# - These layers contain the majority of the model's parameters and hence are most prone to overfitting.
# 
# The dropout probabilities will be proportional to the number of parameters in each layer:
# - First linear layer: Higher dropout rate (e.g., 0.3)
#   - Contains more parameters due to the transition from convolutional features
#   - Maps from flattened conv output to units
# - Second linear layer: Lower dropout rate (e.g., 0.1)
#   - Contains fewer parameters
#   - Maps from units to units
# 
# To evaluate the effectiveness of dropout, we'll compare three dropout configurations against a baseline.
# 
# For example:
# 1. Baseline (no dropout)
# 2. Light dropout (0.2, 0.1)
# 3. Moderate dropout (0.3, 0.1)
# 4. Heavy dropout (0.4, 0.2)

# ### Discussion
# 
# 1. **Training Loss Behavior**
#    - All dropout configurations show consistently higher training loss compared to the baseline
#    - This is expected and desirable, because higher loss indicates the model cannot simply memorize the training data
# 
# 2. **Validation Performance**
#    - The baseline model's validation loss begins increasing after 8 epochs (overfitting)
#    - Dropout models maintain stable or decreasing validation loss, after 8 epochs
# 
# The results show that models with dropout can generalise better.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# Even though all regularization methods were effective, dropout showed clear improvement for the validation set across all configurations. While the baseline model's validation loss started to increase, models with dropout continued to learn and improve their accuracy.

# # Batch Normalization (without REG, with SGD)
# 
# Batch Normalization is a technique to normalize the inputs to each layer in the network.
# 
# For a batch of size m, given input x, BatchNorm computes:
# 
# $$ \text{BatchNorm}(x) = \gamma \frac{x - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta $$
# 
# where:
# - Î¼áµ¦ is the batch mean
# - Ïƒáµ¦Â² is the batch variance
# - Îµ is a small constant for numerical stability
# - Î³, Î² are learnable parameters
# 
# For each feature (channel):
# 
# 1. Normalizes the values across the current batch to have zero mean and unit variance
# 2. Applies learnable scale (Î³) and shift (Î²) parameters
# 3. During backprop, these parameters are updated along with the rest of the networks weights, to learn the optimal scale and shift for each feature.
# 
# Key benefits:
# - Reduces internal covariate shift (changes in the distribution of layer inputs during training)
# - Faster convergence
# - Allows higher learning rates
# - Helps mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients by keeping activations in a reasonable range

# ## Discussion
# 
# We observe:
# 
# - Convergence was achieved significantly faster compared to baseline
# - Signs of overfitting were observed after 8 epochs
# - Higher accuracy was demonstrated overall
# 
# 1. **Convergence and Overfitting**
#    - Faster convergence can be attributed to gradient updates that were stabilized and covariate shift that was reduced
#    - Earlier overfitting was triggered by this accelerated training
#    - Faster Training = Faster Overfitting
# 
# 2. **Considerations**
# 
#    a) **Early Stopping**
#       - Training could be terminated around epoch 8 when validation metrics begin to diverge
# 
#    b) **Batch Statistics**
#       - Differences between training and validation batch statistics should be anticipated
#       - Smaller Batch = Greater Noise
#       - Larger batch sizes could be considered
# 
#    c) **Additional Regularization**
#       - BatchNorm could be combined with other regularization techniques like dropout or L2, to prevent overfitting

# # Adam
# 
# Adam is an optimizer that maintains two additional values for each parameter:
# 
# - A running average of past gradients (momentum)
# - A running average of squared past gradients (velocity)
# 
# By doing so:
# 
# - Each parameter's learning rate is adjusted based on its gradient history
# - Parameters that receive **large** or **frequent** updates will get smaller learning rates
# - Parameters that receive **smaller** or **less frequent** updates will get bigger learning rates
# 
# Expectations:
# - Adam should converge faster compared to SGD
# - Adam with regularization could mitigate overfitting

# ## Discussion
# 
# We observe:
# 
# 1. **Convergence**
#    - Adam converges significantly faster than SGD, due to Adam's adaptive learning rates 
# 
# 2. **Regularization Effects**
#    - Dropout shows the most promising results when combined with Adam
#    - L1 and L2 regularization appear less effective with Adam, possibly because:
#      - Adam's adaptive learning rates may already provide some implicit regularization
#      - The chosen regularization strengths might need adjustment for Adam
# 
# 3. **Validation Performance**
#    - Dropout + Adam shows the best validation performance, though the improvement over base Adam is modest
# 
# Considerations:
# 1. Adam as the default optimizer for this architecture
# 2. Considering higher dropout rates (e.g., 0.5, 0.6) to potentially improve generalization
# 3. If using L1/L2 regularization with Adam, implement it through AdamW or adjust the regularization strengths
# 
# Conclusion:
# 
# The combination of Adam with dropout regularization provides the best balance of training speed and model performance so far.

# # Analysis Confidence
# 
# By training the model with k-fold cross validation we will estimate an confidence interval, to which extend the model will make errors
